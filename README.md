This an program that is able to recognize hand gestures and you are able to save coordinations of hand joints for extracting data if you like(By pressing f).
you can quit using(q).
In future I'll be making an model and train it around example data like the ones that is already peresent in GesData.
Right now it is in json but i might convert it to csv format.
Any help for saving coordinations data for diffrent gestures is appriciated.
