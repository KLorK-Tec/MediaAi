This a program for recognizing hand gestures and you are able to save coordinations of hand joints for extracting data if you like(By pressing f).
you can quit using(q).
In future I'll be making an model and train it around example data like the ones that is already peresent in GesData.
Right now it is in json but i might convert it to csv format.
you should checkout my other program in this project(normalizer) that transforms raw coordinates to vecctor data based on heuristics so you can understand what can we do with this kinda data.
Any help for saving coordinations data for diffrent gestures is appriciated.
